# Movie Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis performed on a movie dataset as part of the "Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning" course by IBM on Coursera.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze trends in movie data to uncover insights about:

- Genre popularity
- Revenue and budget patterns
- Ratings distribution
- Year-wise movie production
- Correlation between variables

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

- Action and Drama are among the most common genres.
- Movies with higher budgets tend to generate more revenue, though the relationship is not strictly linear.
- Most movies have moderate ratings, typically ranging from 6 to 7.5.
- The number of movies produced annually has generally increased over time.
